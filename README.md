In my smart mirror, I wanted to include some of the main functions that I feel like a mirror would have

1) Time
2) Weather
3) Calendar
4) News Feed
5) Some kind of health field, in this case I chose weight

### Sketch

Here I include my sketch of my original design.
I think it works well and is easy to follow, with the clock being in the top left, followed by the calendar on the top right
This is then followed by the weather in the bottom left, which includes your current location, degrees in Fahrenheit as well as the current weather for the day,
as well as the forecast for later in the day.
There is a news feed at the bottom in smaller text, because to me this isn't as important as some of the other things. Lastly, the weight in lbs is in the bottom right.

### Code Implementation

In my code implementation, I followed my sketch for the most part, and I made each section of the mirror that has information easily discernable from
everything else on the mirror, and in different colors.
